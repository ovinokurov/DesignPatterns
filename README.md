# Design Patterns Project

This project serves as an educational resource to understand different design patterns by providing simple examples. The goal is to demonstrate the implementation of various design patterns using a straightforward and easy-to-understand example project.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to help developers understand and learn about different design patterns. Each design pattern is implemented in a specific section of the project, showcasing its key concepts and how it can be applied in practice. Developers can explore the source code and see how each design pattern is implemented and used.

## Design Patterns Implemented

The project currently contains the following design patterns:

1. Singleton Pattern
2. Factory Pattern
3. Observer Pattern (Work in Progress)

## How to Use

To explore each design pattern, navigate to the respective section in the `Program.cs` file. Each section is labeled accordingly, making it easy to locate and understand the code related to a specific design pattern.

To run the project and see the output of each design pattern, build and execute the project in your preferred C# development environment.

## Contributions

Contributions to this project are welcome! If you would like to contribute additional design patterns or improvements to the existing code, please follow the standard GitHub workflow:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch for your changes
3. Make the necessary modifications
4. Create a pull request to merge your changes

Please ensure that your contributions align with the educational nature of the project and follow good coding practices.
